    Version 0.02

SYNOPSIS
      use Media::Type::Simple;

      $type = type_from_ext("jpg");        # returns "image/jpeg"

      $ext  = ext_from_type("text/plain"); # returns "txt"  

DESCRIPTION
    This package gives a simple functions for obtaining common file
    extensions from media types, and from obtaining media types from file
    extensions.

    It is also relaxed with respect to having multiple media types
    associated with a file extension, or multiple extensions associated with
    a media type, and it includes media types for encodings such as gzip. It
    is defined this way in the default data, but this does not meet your
    needs, then you can have it use a system file (e.g. /etc/mime.types) or
    custom data.

    By default, there is a functional interface, although you can also use
    an object-oriented inteface. (Different objects will not share the same
    data.)

REVISION HISTORY
    For a detailed history see the Changes file included in this
    distribution.

SEE ALSO
    The MIME::Types module has a similar functionality, but with a more
    complex interface.

    the media types is based on the Debian mime-support package,
    http://packages.debian.org/mime-support, although with *many* changes
    from the original.
