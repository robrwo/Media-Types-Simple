NAME
    Media::Type::Simple - MIME Types and their file extensions

REQUIREMENTS
    The following non-core modules are required:

      Exporter::Lite
      File::Share
      File::ShareDir

SYNOPSIS
      use Media::Type::Simple;

      $type = type_from_ext("jpg");        # returns "image/jpeg"

      $ext  = ext_from_type("text/plain"); # returns "txt"

DESCRIPTION
    This package gives a simple functions for obtaining common file
    extensions from media types, and from obtaining media types from file
    extensions.

    It is also relaxed with respect to having multiple media types
    associated with a file extension, or multiple extensions associated with
    a media type, and it includes media types for encodings such as `gzip'.
    It is defined this way in the default data, but this does not meet your
    needs, then you can have it use a system file (e.g. /etc/mime.types) or
    custom data.

    By default, there is a functional interface, although you can also use
    an object-oriented interface. (Different objects will not share the same
    data.)

REVISION HISTORY
    For a detailed history see the Changes file included in this
    distribution.

SEE ALSO
    The MIME::Types module has a similar functionality, but with a more
    complex interface.

    LWP::MediaTypes will guess the media type from a file extension,
    attempting to use the ~/.media.types file.

    An "official" list of Media Types can be found at

    the media types is based on the Debian `mime-support' package,

    from the original.
